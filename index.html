                        <p>
                            Hi! My name is Natalie and I am a 20-year-old science student and educator from Sydney, Australia. I have been interested in collecting 
                            books since high school, where I fell in love with the 1980s Coroneos textbook my Year 11 maths teacher showed my class - something about 
                            the typewritten pages littered with hand-drawn diagrams was so much more appealing than the computer-generated textbooks I had for all my 
                            other subjects. The first book in my collection was an anniversary "gift" that a long-ex boyfriend found on the side of the road, and most
                            of my books since then have also been those neglected by other collectors, forgotten pieces of history that I can preserve (and spend many
                            hours making a website for).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My collection currently comprises around twenty books on various STEM topics, predominantly astronomy and physics - I collect these areas 
                            as I am currently in working towards a degree in astrophysics. I find it invaluable to have access to the history of the modern concepts 
                            I hear about in my lectures, as I believe science is at its most valuable when we acknowledge how it has developed over time. To quote my 
                            2023 entry to the Australian Young Book Collector's Prize:
                            <div class = "quotebox">
                                <i>
                                    "I collect books to preserve knowledge and use it to inform both myself and others. When my astrophysics homework leaves me lost, I 
                                    have hundreds of years of background information to set me on the right path. When my young students bombard me with “why” in response 
                                    to whatever answer I give them, I am prepared to take them on a journey through decades of technological advancement. When the world is 
                                    faced with uncertainty, I know I have the voices of thousands of academics, scientists, and researchers preserved in ink, and an internet 
                                    connection through which to share it."
